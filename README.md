# MultiPattern Match Tool

Match a given text with multiple patterns(plain texts or simple regular expressions).

Using RoboTrie Algorithm (An enhanced algorithm based on Trie).

Time complexity: Average O(n) if patterns are all plain texts.

Average O(n^2) if patterns contains 3000 plain texts and 1500 regex.

Performance of RoboTrie and Aho-Corasick automaton (Not tested currently)

Currently, the regex only supports symbol '.\*', I will add supports of other symbols in the future.
